# Exercise 1 - Introduction

This exercise will get you started learning the basics of writing and running some tests in an IDE (Integrated Development Environemnt).

We are going to assume you have IntelliJ Community Edition installed.

You will learn how to:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Create your first unit tests
3. Structure your tests properly

## 1. Dev environment

> **Before you begin**: Please make sure that you have the following installed:
- IntelliJ Community Edition: [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Java dev kit: [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)


* Open `pom.xml` in IntelliJ by selecting **"Open"** in the Welcome screen:

* Then select **"Open as Project"**

![](../images/intellij-open-as-project.png)

This will create a IntelliJ project from the Maven `pom.xml`.

## 2. Creating your first unit test

- Describe exercise code here.
- Create a test class
- Create a test
- Run it (show how using screenshots?)

## 3. Test structure

- Identify the _Given_, _When_, _What_ sections of the test you just wrote by inserting comments and line breaks to make it clearer.
- Give the test a better name
